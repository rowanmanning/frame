Frame
=====

Frame is a light-weight HTML scaffold for you to test your stylesheets against.  
That's all, just a HTML document with lots of elements. It's useful!

Using Frame
-----------

Do what you like with it! I use it when I'm starting a new site build to test my initial (mainly typographic) styles; just grab the HTML file and stick your stylesheet in it. You can see an example of this in use on [my personal website][rowan].

Here are some other ideas:

 * Test your blog/CMS themes
 * Use it to build rough style-guides for clients
 * Fork it and build your own scaffold
 * Use it to illustrate my misundersanding of how certain elements should be marked up ;)
