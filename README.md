Frame
=====

Frame is a light-weight HTML scaffold for you to test your
stylesheets against.  
That's all, just a HTML document with lots of elements. It's
useful!


Using Frame
-----------

Do what you like with it! I use it when I'm starting a new site
build to test my initial (mainly typographic) styles; just grab
the HTML file and stick your stylesheet in it.

Here are some other ideas:

 * Test your blog/CMS themes
 * Use it to build rough early style demos for clients
 * Fork it and build your own scaffold
 * Use it to illustrate my misundersanding of how certain elements should me marked up ;)
